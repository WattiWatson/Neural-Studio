                <h2>First steps in creating Neural Studio</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;As of today, we have completed the draft of the Software Requirements 
                    Specification document, created our <a href="https://github.com/WattiWatson/Neural-Studio" style="color:#753C29;">GitHub</a> page, 
                    and began initial planning of the project. We have talked to Dr. Butler (a data science professor) 
                    who has some experience in building neural networks to gain a better understanding of the end goal.
                    We have also began making some initial progress in building out the sequential neural network for the Iris dataset.
                    Overall, these last couple weeks have been crucial to the beginning of the project and 
                    setting a clear goal that we will aim to achieve by the end of the deadline. Our current next steps 
                    are getting our Kanban backlog up to date and continue making progress on the code and structure of the program itself.
