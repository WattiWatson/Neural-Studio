                <h2>Planning Continues: Development Begun!</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;After finishing our final draft of our Software Requirements Doc,
                    meetings this week were mostly on topics of project distribution and getting everyone set up
                    to work on code development. We have begun work on our Kanban Schedule through Github and have begun the draft of our first
                    Press Release Poster (coming soon).<br />
                    &emsp;On the development side, the Iris dataset is done being implemented into our program, and we are in the beginning steps
                    of creating the framework of our visualization(2D) GUI. The visualization is looking promising, and we are currently working on the challenge
                    of combining the visualization and the first dataset! Progress on the second dataset, MNist, will be started shortly, though its already
                    looking to be more challenging than the first.

                <h2>First steps in creating Neural Studio</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;As of today, we have completed the draft of the Software Requirements
                    Specification document, created our <a href="https://github.com/WattiWatson/Neural-Studio" style="color:#753C29;">GitHub</a> page,
                    and began initial planning of the project. We have talked to Dr. Butler (a data science professor)
                    who has some experience in building neural networks to gain a better understanding of the end goal.
                    We have also began making some initial progress in building out the sequential neural network for the Iris dataset.
                    Overall, these last couple weeks have been crucial to the beginning of the project and
                    setting a clear goal that we will aim to achieve by the end of the deadline. Our current next steps
                    are getting our Kanban backlog up to date and continue making progress on the code and structure of the program itself.
